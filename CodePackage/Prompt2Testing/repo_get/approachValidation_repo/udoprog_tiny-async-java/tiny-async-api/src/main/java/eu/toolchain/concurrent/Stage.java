/**
 * An interface that defines a contract with a computation that could be asynchronous.
 *
 * <p>All methods are <em>thread-safe</em> guaranteeing that interactions with the stage are atomic.
 *
 * <p>A stage has four states:<ul>
 *
 * <li><em>pending</em>, which indicates that the stage is awaiting completion.</li>
 *
 * <li><em>completed</em>, which indicates that the stage has been completed.</li>
 *
 * <li><em>failed</em>, the stage has failed to be completed.</li>
 *
 * <li><em>cancelled</em>, the stage has been cancelled.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The last three states are characterized as <em>end states</em>, a stage can only
 * transition into one of these, and when in an end-state will never go into another state. If a
 * stage is in and end state it is considered <em>done</em>, as is indicated by the
 * {@link #isDone()} method.
 *
 * <p>Naming conventions of methods are the following:<ul>
 *
 * <li>{@code is*}, methods that query if the stage has reached a certain state.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@code when*}, method that will be called once the stage reaches a certain state, but
 * otherwise has no effect on the stage. The returned stage does not have to wait for the operation
 * provided to end.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@code then*}, method that will be called once the stage reaches a certain state, and
 * modifies the stage when that state has been reached</li>
 *
 * <li>{@code with*}, method that will be called once the stage reaches a certain state, but does
 * modify the stage. But, the resulting stage must wait for the operation provided to the method
 * to end.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
