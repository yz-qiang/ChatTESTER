# CloudSync Home Directory (MODIFY IF DESIRED)
#
# This is where CloudSync logs and data are are stored. If undefined here, the
# system property of the same name will be checked. If also undefined as a
# system property, the CLOUDSYNC_HOME environment variable will be checked.
# If also undefined as an environment variable, the value
# "${user.home}/.cloudsync" will be used.

#cloudsync.home = C:\\data\\fedora-cloudsync
#cloudsync.home = /var/lib/fedora-cloudsync

#
# Other Required System Properties (DO NOT MODIFY)
#
# All properties below will be set as System Properties when the webapp
# starts. They are mostly used to control options in libraries where
# Spring-based configuration is impossible or impractical.
#

# This project has standardized on SLF4J; this tells CXF to use it.
