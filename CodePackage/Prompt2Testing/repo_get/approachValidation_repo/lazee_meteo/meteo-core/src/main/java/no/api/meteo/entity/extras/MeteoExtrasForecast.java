/**
 * This is a special customized forecast containing a mix of information for a given period of time.
 *
 * <p>As explained in the api.met.no faq (https://api.met.no/faq.html#times) it doesn't make sense to give symbols and
 * precipitation for a given point in time. This only make sense for a given period.</p>
 *
 * <p>But in the Extras api we sometimes wants to return a PointForecast with a corresponding PeriodForecast, meaning a
 * PeriodForecast for the period that the PointForecast is in. We also want to add information of whether the period is
 * at night or not. More data will be added along the way.</p>
