# Performance Test Suite for Ostrich

## Objective

The point of this performance test is to be able to recreate Ostrich performance problems observed in 
 production, with the eventual aim of being able to fix those performance problems.

Anecdotally, services would run fine as long as the total number of requests-per-second to an Ostrich 
 service pool was low. As the requests per second to the Ostrich Service Pool increased, the performance
 of Ostrich would degrade, sometimes catastrophically.

This test has many parameters that can be adjusted

  * The requests-per-second to Ostrich
  * What work the "Ostrich client" does for each request
  * Ostrich "pool" parameters (How and when Ostrich will request new Client Objects for each Endpoint)

Note this test is specifically testing a "backend" component of Ostrich (the ServiceCache) that we've 
 identified as a problem. This does not test Ostrich as a whole

There should be a "black box" perf test for Ostrich in the future.   

## Defining Services and Caches

We have a fixed number of singleton services that performs cryptographic hash on a given String. A service 
factory provides a wrapper for those services and returned a wrapped service as and when requested by the 
 ServiceCache.
 
A service cache is initialized with various parameters such as max number of service instances, idle time 
 before evicting a (wrapped) service instance, policy to  adhere upon cache is exhausted, etc. A detailed 
 breakdown of available parameters are provided in the Parameters section.

## Running The Suite

To determine the performance of Ostrich under varying loads, this test suite takes various parameters. They 
 allow us to set the load on the cache, i.e. # of worker threads using the cache, the load on each thread,
 i.e. how much work each worker thread must do, etc. These help us to determine the overhead of ostrich 
 under nominal to mediocre to somewhat heavy loads. 

After determining and setting those desired values the suite will run the desired number of threads and
 load, and will monitor the health and performance of the cache.

## Running Example

### Build the assembled dependency included jar

    mvn clean compile assembly:single

This creates a shaded jar called test-suite-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar with all dependencies included.

### Run the suite

#### For the following configuration:

    - Heap size: 2GB (or more, based on how many threads you want to run), JIT disabled
    - threads: 25, work size: 12000Bytes
    - cache idle time: 10 seconds, cache max instance per service: 10, cache exhaust action: GROW
    - print statistics, output ot file output.csv, report every 5 second, run for 30 second 

#### The command would be:

    java -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xms2048m -jar test-suite-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --thread-size 25 --work-size 12000 \
    --idle-time 10 --max-instances 10 --exhaust-action GROW \
    --statistics --report-every 5 --run-time 30 --output-file output.csv

Or

    java -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xms2048m -jar test-suite-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t 25 -w 12000 -i 10 -m 10 -e GROW -s -v 5 -r 30 -o output.csv
