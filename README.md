The data contained within this folder serves as a dataset used in our paper. We have organized the folders based on section names for clarity and reference. For instance, the ``Effectiveness Evaluation'' folder encompasses data utilized for evaluating the effectiveness of ChatTester as described in this paper.

Furthermore, we have included the distribution of iteration numbers in ChatTester, represented in ".png" files. Each PNG file encompasses the following three fields:

- **Iteration Number**: This indicates the iteration count.
- **Test Method**: This field denotes the quantity of test methods within the current iteration.
- **Success Compilation**: It signifies the number of test methods that have successfully completed compilation for the specified number of iterations.
- **Passing Execution**: This field quantifies the number of test methods that can be executed successfully within the current iteration.
