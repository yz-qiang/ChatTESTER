The data contained within this folder serves as a dataset used in our paper. We have organized the folders based on section names for clarity and reference. For instance, the ``Effectiveness Evaluation'' folder encompasses data utilized for evaluating the effectiveness of ChatTester as described in this paper.

Furthermore, we have included the distribution of iteration numbers in ChatTester, represented in ".png" files. Each PNG file encompasses the following four fields: ``# Iteration`` indicates the iteration count; ``# Test Method`` denotes the number of test methods within the current iteration; ``# Success Compilation`` and ``# Passing Execution`` represents the number of test methods that can be successfully compiled and executed in the current iteration, respectively.
